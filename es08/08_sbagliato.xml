        <p>People have taken to calling me “the Reaper”. Only once have I ever been thanked for my work.</p>

        <p>This was awful. This had to have been one of the worst nights of my life.</p>

        <p>My pursuers had grown in number once again. They were dividing, at an incredible rate. Monsters who lived
            only to
            separate humans by component parts; no matter how many I cut down, I couldn’t stem the tide.</p>

        <p>The Material Barrier that coated every inch of my skin had dwindled to its base parameters. A single solid
            hit would
            be enough to blow me to pieces, like a plate dropped on the floor. But I had a strange premonition that all
            this was
            only a prelude to what was waiting for me; to what would really make this the worst night of my life.</p>
